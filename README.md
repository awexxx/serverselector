# Awex's Server Selector
Howdy! Welcome to the repo of my server selector!
This was built with the purpose of serving the [PC Network](https://plaguecraft.xyz/).
###### Beta Builds
I'll probably be pushing beta builds of the plugin to [my website](https://awexxx.github.io/server-selector).
## TO DO LIST:
- [ ] Build Config File
- [ ] Develop clickable compass for menu
- [ x ] Developed /menu for opening the compass menu. Games can be changed at a later date (related to Config file).
